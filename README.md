CryptoShare
===========

An open-source example of how to read and write encrypted files to Dropbox.

This is a work in progress, and a bit of a sandbox.

The high level goal is to have a working proof of concept app that:

- Connects to Dropbox
- Supports passphrase entry to encrypt data that will be stored in Dropbox
- Supports passphrase entry to decrypt data that has been previously stored

Hopefully this will work both on iOS as well as OS X.

Right now, it's just a skeleton of an iOS app.
